# MAT270-hw2

- `kmeans.py` contains my code for writing a kMeans algorithm
- `spectral_clustering.py` contains my code for creating spectral clusters to feed into kMeans
- `diffusion_map.py` contains my code for creating a diffusion map

- `problem3.ipynb` is where I visualized data for problem 3, and did hyperparameter tuning on kMeans and spectral clustering
- `problem4.ipynb` is where I preprocessed the genome dataset, and did hyperparameter tuning on PCA and diffusion maps
